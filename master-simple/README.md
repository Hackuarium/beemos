# Master board
This board is connected to all other modules via i2c and sends all the data to a remote server using a SIM card. It also uses a temperature sensor to monitor the internal temperature of the hive. 

_We are currently using a simplified version of the Master board for debugging purpose. A more complete version with the temperature sensor will come later and is in development._

## Components
* x1 Microprocessor Atmel 32u4 (similar to Arduino Leonardo boards), 8Mhz, 3.3V
