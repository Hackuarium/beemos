# BeeMoS - honey Bee Monitoring System<br/> (under development)

_[Lire en fran√ßais](README.fr.md)_

The BeeMoS project is an open source bee hive monitoring system developed at the open science lab Hackuarium, Renens, Switzerland.

# Objectives

Build and program an open source bee monitoring system capable of the following objectives:

- [x] Track the activity of the hives to study the behaviour of bees and monitor their health.
- [x] Track changes in the hive's weight over time to detect sudden and gradual changes (swarming, honey production ...).
- [x] Measures environmental variables including temperature, humidity, light and atmospheric pressure and study their effect on the bees.
- [ ] Send the data to a remote server for analysis, visualization or to notify the user if something unusual happens.

# Cloning the project

This project uses SUBMODULES

In order to clone use:

`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/hackuarium/beemos`

To update the submodules

`git submodule update --recursive --remote`

# Modules

To achieve the above objectives, the project follows a modular design with different hardware components.

[**Counter**](counter-i2c/README.md): Counts bees entering and exiting the hive over time using infrared sensors.

Here is the orientation of the IR sensors at the back of the PCB. Be careful, the orientation of the Eagle file is seen from the top.

</p>

[**Scale**](scale-i2c/README.md): Weighs the hive periodically using 4 load cells.

[**Weather station**](weather-i2c/README.md): Monitors temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure and luminosity outside the hives.

</p>

[**Master board**](master/README.md): Communicates with all other devices over I2C, log data in memory and sends the data to a remote server using a SIM card module. May also track temperature inside the hive.

[**Simple master**](master-simple/README.md): A simple master board with I2C RJ-12 socket to
make some tests.

# State of the project

We have designed and ordered the PCBs for the bee counter, weather station, scale and master boards. These four boards have been assembled and programmed. We also built a laser cut wooden enclosure which contains the bee counter PCB. It includes 8 individual gates that the bees use to enter/exit the hive and an upper compartment for the board so that sensor are on top of entering bees. A few field trials were launched to assess the accuracy of the bee counter but we still need to fix some things in the hardware and software to get it working. To solve these issues, Clara has joined the BeeMoS team to make some tests of the bee counter in a controlled setting with live bees (transparent box with the beecounter inside and a camera to record video of entering/exiting bees that will be compared to the readings from the board).

The weather board can now show temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure and relative light intensity. The scale board v1.0 has been soldered, a minor fix was needed to get it to work. The next steps will be to get the bee counter to work accurately by performing controlled tests, to assess the accuracy of the scale over time and to be able to send data wireless, integrate it to a database and plot it in an attractive way.

We have assembled a completed kit, containing:
- 1 master board
- 1 counter board
- 1 scale board
- 1 weather board
- 1 Si7021 humidity captor
- 1 solar panel
- 2 temperature captors (one wire DS18B20)
- 3 cables
- 1 battery 3.7V, 6600mA/h
- 1 wooden counter box
- 1 plastic box (to contain the master, scale and weather boards)
Here is what the kit actually look like:

</p>

We already have assembled and tested some parts of it (the master, weight and weather boards in particular), but on an empty hive. The master board seems to log correctly and we are able to read the logs afterwards. Some things need to be fixed, for example sometimes the master board stops recording for long periods of time.

We will now procede to a complete test with the full kit on a real hive.
